## Traditional Installation (Non-Docker)

If you prefer to run the bot without Docker, follow these steps:

### 1. Install FFmpeg

#### Windows:
1. Download the FFmpeg build from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or use a package manager like Chocolatey.
2. Add FFmpeg to your system PATH.
3. Verify the installation by running `ffmpeg -version` in your terminal.

#### Linux:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

#### macOS:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### 2. Configure and Run the Bot

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Disc0-0/discord-voice-announcer-unraid.git
   cd discord-voice-announcer-unraid
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (PowerShell) or `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat` (Command Prompt)
   - Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file with your Discord bot token:
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   VOICE_LANGUAGE=en
   COMMAND_PREFIX=!
   ANNOUNCE_JOINS=True
   ANNOUNCE_LEAVES=True
   WHITELIST_MODE=False
   ```

6. Start the bot:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the bot is running and has joined your server, it will automatically join voice channels when someone enters and announce their arrival.

### Commands

The bot responds to the following commands:

- `!announce [message]` - Test the announcement system with an optional custom message
- `!status` - Display information about the bot's current status and configuration
- `!togglejoins` - Toggle whether the bot announces when users join voice channels
- `!toggleleaves` - Toggle whether the bot announces when users leave voice channels
- `!togglewhitelist` - Toggle between announcing all users or only whitelisted users
- `!whitelist add @user` - Add a user to the announcement whitelist
- `!whitelist remove @user` - Remove a user from the announcement whitelist
- `!whitelist list` - List all users in the announcement whitelist
- `!addcustom @user join|leave message` - Add a custom announcement message for a specific user
- `!removecustom @user join|leave|both` - Remove custom announcement message(s) for a specific user
- `!listcustom` - List all custom announcement messages

## Configuration Options

You can modify the following options in the `.env` file:

```
# Your Discord bot token (required)
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here

# Language for TTS announcements (default: en)
VOICE_LANGUAGE=en

# Command prefix (default: !)
COMMAND_PREFIX=!

# Whether to announce when users join channels (default: True)
ANNOUNCE_JOINS=True

# Whether to announce when users leave channels (default: True)
ANNOUNCE_LEAVES=True

# Whether to only announce whitelisted users (default: False)
WHITELIST_MODE=False
```

## Custom Announcements

The bot supports custom personalized announcements for specific users. This feature allows you to set unique messages that play when certain users join or leave voice channels.

### Setting Up Custom Announcements

Custom announcements are stored in the `custom_announcements.json` file, but the recommended way to manage them is through bot commands.

#### Adding Custom Announcements

To add a custom announcement for a user:

```
!addcustom @Username join The legendary {username} has arrived!
```

Or for leave announcements:

```
!addcustom @Username leave {username} has vanished into thin air!
```

The `{username}` placeholder will be replaced with the user's display name.

#### Removing Custom Announcements

To remove custom announcements for a user:

```
!removecustom @Username join    # Remove just the join message
!removecustom @Username leave   # Remove just the leave message
!removecustom @Username both    # Remove both join and leave messages
```

#### Viewing Custom Announcements

To see all custom announcements:

```
!listcustom
```

### Example Use Cases

- Special announcements for administrators
- Fun custom messages for friends
- Themed announcements for special events
- Different styles for different channels or games

### Notes on Custom Announcements

- Custom announcements require administrator permissions to manage
- The `custom_announcements.json` file updates automatically
- You can use the same `{username}` placeholder multiple times in a message

## Whitelist Mode

The bot supports a whitelist mode that allows you to specify exactly which users should trigger voice announcements. When enabled, only users in the whitelist will generate join/leave announcements.

### Setting Up Whitelist Mode

Whitelist settings are stored in the `announcement_whitelist.json` file, but the recommended way to manage the whitelist is through bot commands.

#### Enabling/Disabling Whitelist Mode

To toggle whitelist mode on or off:

```
!togglewhitelist
```

When enabled, only users in the whitelist will trigger announcements. When disabled, all users will trigger announcements as usual (subject to the join/leave announcement toggles).

#### Managing the Whitelist

To add a user to the whitelist:

```
!whitelist add @Username
```

To remove a user from the whitelist:

```
!whitelist remove @Username
```

To see all users in the whitelist:

```
!whitelist list
```

### Using Whitelist Mode with Custom Announcements

Whitelist mode and custom announcements can be used together. When both are enabled:

1. Only whitelisted users will trigger announcements
2. If a whitelisted user also has a custom announcement, their custom message will be used
3. If a user is not in the whitelist, they won't trigger any announcements even if they have custom messages

### Example Use Cases

- Announce only for specific team members or administrators
- Limit announcements to main players in a gaming channel
- Reduce announcement frequency in busy servers
- Prevent announcement spam from users who frequently join/leave

### Notes on Whitelist Mode

- Requires administrator permissions to manage
- The whitelist is saved between bot restarts
- You can combine whitelist mode with custom announcements for maximum flexibility
- When whitelist mode is enabled but your whitelist is empty, no announcements will be made

## Troubleshooting

### Unraid/Docker Troubleshooting
- **Container keeps restarting**: Check the logs for error messages, particularly related to the Discord token
- **TTS not working**: The container includes FFmpeg, no additional installation is needed
- **Data not persisting**: Check the volume mapping and permissions on your host path
- **Invalid token error**: Verify your token in the container environment variables
- **Cannot find whitelist/custom announcements**: Ensure the data volume is properly mounted
- **Permission issues**: Try adjusting the PUID/PGID environment variables to match your Unraid user

### General Troubleshooting
- **Bot not connecting to voice channels**: Ensure FFmpeg is properly installed (only for non-Docker installations)
- **No sound playing**: Check that your bot has the "Speak" permission in your Discord server
- **Bot disconnecting immediately**: This may happen if the voice channel is empty or if there are connection issues
